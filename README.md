# GitHub Portfolio Generator


This application dynamically creates an HTML file using data from a GitHub user profile and converts the result to a PDf file.  A script file is run using  NodeJS that prompts the user for a GitHub username and a color choice.  Data is then extracted from GitHub and an HTML file and PDF documents are created using the user's color choice in the design of the document.
